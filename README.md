Learn Finance with Fun!

FinLit is our attempt to make the process of improving your financial literacy innovative and fun! Our application consists of quizzes which employ Machine Learning concepts like the Naive-Bayes algorithm and Fuzzy Logic which determine your knowledge level and modify the difficulty level of the quizzes accordingly - hence our quizzes are completely customised to your learning and growth! Finding the quizzes too tough to crack? Worry not, we have Info Bites to help you learn concepts and gain knowledge before attempting the quizzes. What's more? You also get to spread word about the app using our Facebook Share feature. This way you can invite your friends to use the app and game up against each other to see who scores the highest!

Domains: Banking, Tax, Loans, Investments
Upto 160 questions and concepts to learn and crack!

The application has been deployed here:  https://fin-lit2020.herokuapp.com/.

Since, our application is a Progressive Web Application or PWA, you can use it on any device - Laptop, Desktop, Mobile phone - regardless! If you’re using it on your mobile browser, choose ‘Add it to Homepage’ to use it as a mobile application.
