# FinLit

**Learn Finance with Fun!**

FinLit is our attempt to make the process of improving your **financial literacy** innovative and fun! Our application consists of quizzes which employ Machine Learning concepts like the **Naive-Bayes algorithm** and **Fuzzy Logic** which determine your knowledge level and modify the difficulty level of the quizzes accordingly - hence our quizzes are completely customised to your learning and growth! Finding the quizzes too tough to crack? Worry not, we have **Info Bites** to help you learn concepts and gain knowledge before attempting the quizzes. What's more? You also get to spread word about the app using our **Facebook Share** feature. This way you can invite your friends to use the app and game up against each other to see who scores the highest!

**Domains: Banking, Tax, Loans, Investments**<br>
Upto 160 questions and concepts to learn and crack!<br>

The application has been deployed here:  https://fin-lit2020.herokuapp.com/.

Since, our application is a **Progressive Web Application** or **PWA**, you can use it on any device - Laptop, Desktop, Mobile phone - regardless!

<br>

- The user has already taken the Initiation quiz for Banking and therefore, only the Secondary Quiz is available for the same. For Tax and Investments, however, they must first finish the Initiation quizzes:

- As they attempt a **Secondary quiz**, they can see intermediate results, wherein they can see their current score, the difficulty level of the question that's to come next based on the user's performance and finally an option to save their progress:
